		<p>I am currently a junior at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I study data analysis with a minor in statistics. I am a student in the relatively new Bachelor of Science in Information program, which is an interdisciplinary program about information, people, and technology in our data-driven society. I currently have a 4.00 GPA within my major and a 3.41 GPA overall. I have earned an A+ grade in the majority of my in-major classes. </p>

		<p>I had a unique background which led me to choosing to study Data Analysis. In high school, I was very interested in math and science, so I thought Engineering would be the best fit for me. After taking two years of Chemical Engineering courses, I realized it wasnâ€™t a good fit for me, so I decided to take a risk and switch majors. After consulting with numerous people and resources, I realized that I have a great interest and talent in gathering, manipulating, and analyzIng data, so I decided to apply for the School of Information and was fortunate to be accepted.</p>

		<p>On a personal note, I grew up in Potomac, Maryland, which is 12 miles outside of Washington, DC. I am a big sports fan and root for all the DC sports teams. I live in Ann Arbor and have a one year old labradoodle named Ovie (who has his own page on this website). </p>
